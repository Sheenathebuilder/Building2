 Account Lockout & Unlock Simulation LObjective
Simulate a real-world helpdesk scenario where a user account becomes locked due to multiple failed login attempts, then perform the proper administrative steps to unlock the account.

 Scenario

A user reports:
 “I can’t log in. It says my account is locked.”

This lab simulates that ticket and documents the resolution process.

 Steps Performed

 1. Configured Account Lockout Policy

Using Local Security Policy:

Opened `secpol.msc`
Navigated to:
  Account Policies → Account Lockout Policy
Configured:
  Account lockout threshold: 3 invalid attempts
  Lockout duration: 15 minutes
  Reset lockout counter after: 15 minutes

This simulates a real corporate security configuration.



2. Triggered Account Lockout

- Attempted to log in as `helpdesk_test`
- Entered incorrect password 3 times
- Account became locked as expected

 3. Verified and Unlocked the Account

Logged in as administrator (`azureadmin`):

- Opened `lusrmgr.msc`
- Navigated to:
  Local Users and Groups → Users
- Opened the affected account
- Confirmed “Account is locked out”
- Unchecked the lockout box
- Applied changes

User was then able to successfully log in.
